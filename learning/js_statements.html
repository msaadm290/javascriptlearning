    <!-- JavaScript Programs
A computer program is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer.

In a programming language, these programming instructions are called statements.

A JavaScript program is a list of programming statements. -->

Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments.

This statement tells the browser to write "Hello Dolly." inside an HTML element with id="demo":

    <h2>JavaScript Statements</h2>

    <p>In HTML, JavaScript statements are executed by the browser.</p>

    <p id="expression"></p>

    <script>
        document.getElementById("expression").innerHTML = "Hello Dolly. ";
    </script>



    <!-- JavaScript Line Length and Line Breaks
For best readability, programmers often like to avoid code lines longer than 80 characters.

If a JavaScript statement does not fit on one line, the best place to break it is after an operator: -->

    <h2>JavaScript Statements</h2>

    <p>
        The best place to break a code line is after an operator or a comma.
    </p>

    <p id="operator"></p>

    <script>
        document.getElementById("operator").innerHTML =
            "Hello Dolly!";
    </script>



    <!-- JavaScript Code Blocks
JavaScript statements can be grouped together in code blocks, inside curly brackets {...}.

The purpose of code blocks is to define statements to be executed together.

One place you will find statements grouped together in blocks, is in JavaScript functions: -->

    <p>JavaScript code blocks are written between { and }</p>

    <button type="button" onclick="myFunction()">Click Me!</button>

    <p id="x"></p>
    <p id="y"></p>

    <script>
        function myFunction() {
            document.getElementById("x").innerHTML = "Hello Saad!";
            document.getElementById("y").innerHTML = "How are you?";
        }
