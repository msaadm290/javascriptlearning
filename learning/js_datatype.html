<!-- JavaScript has 8 Datatypes
1. String
2. Number
3. Bigint
4. Boolean
5. Undefined
6. Null
7. Symbol
8. Object

The Object Datatype
The object data type can contain:

1. An object
2. An array
3. A date -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<!-- The Concept of Data Types
In programming, data types is an important concept.

To be able to operate on variables, it is important to know something about the type.

Without data types, a computer cannot safely solve this: -->

<!-- JavaScript evaluates expressions from left to right. Different sequences can produce different results: -->

<h2>JavaScript Data Types</h2>

<p>JavaScript has dynamic types. This means that the same variable can be used to hold different data types:</p>

<p id="type"></p>

<script>
let x;         // Now x is undefined
x = 5;         // Now x is a Number
x = "John";    // Now x is a String

document.getElementById("type").innerHTML = x;


</script>

<!-- JavaScript Strings
A string (or a text string) is a series of characters like "John Doe".

Strings are written with quotes. You can use single or double quotes:-->


<h2>JavaScript Strings</h2>

<p>Strings are written with quotes. You can use single or double quotes:</p>

<p id="cnam"></p>

<script>
let carName1 = "Volvo XC60";
let carName2 = 'Volvo XC60';

document.getElementById("cnam").innerHTML =
carName1 + "<br>" + 
carName2; 
</script>

<!-- You can use quotes inside a string, as long as they don't match the quotes surrounding the string: -->

<!-- JavaScript Numbers
All JavaScript numbers are stored as decimal numbers (floating point).

Numbers can be written with, or without decimals: -->


<h2>JavaScript Numbers</h2>

<p>Numbers can be written with, or without decimals:</p>

<p id="num"></p>

<script>
let x1 = 34.00;
let x2 = 34;
let x3 = 3.14;

document.getElementById("num").innerHTML =
x1 + "<br>" + x2 + "<br>" + x3;
</script>

<!-- Exponential Notation
Extra large or extra small numbers can be written with scientific (exponential) notation: -->


<h2>JavaScript Numbers</h2>

<p>Extra large or extra small numbers can be written with scientific (exponential) notation:</p>

<p id="elnum"></p>

<script>
let y = 123e5;
let z = 123e-5;

document.getElementById("elnum").innerHTML =
y + "<br>" + z;
</script>


<!-- Note
Most programming languages have many number types:

Whole numbers (integers):
byte (8-bit), short (16-bit), int (32-bit), long (64-bit)

Real numbers (floating-point):
float (32-bit), double (64-bit).

Javascript numbers are always one type:
double (64-bit floating point).

You will learn more about numbers later in this tutorial. -->

<!-- JavaScript BigInt
All JavaScript numbers are stored in a a 64-bit floating-point format.

JavaScript BigInt is a new datatype (ES2020) that can be used to 
store integer values that are too big to be represented by a normal JavaScript Number. -->

<h1>JavScript Bigint</h1>
<p>A BigInt can not have decimals.</p>

<p id="bint"></p>

<p>You cannot perform math between a BigInt type and a Number type.</p>

<script>
let d = BigInt("123456789012345678901234567890");
document.getElementById("bint").innerHTML = d; 
</script>

<!-- JavaScript Booleans
Booleans can only have two values: true or false. -->

<h2>JavaScript Booleans</h2>

<p>Booleans can have two values: true or false:</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
let a = 5;
let b = 5;
let c = 6;

document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
(a == b) + "<br>" + (a == c);

</script>
