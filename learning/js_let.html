    <!-- Block Scope
Before ES6 (2015), JavaScript did not have Block Scope.

JavaScript had Global Scope and Function Scope.

ES6 introduced the two new JavaScript keywords: let and const.

These two keywords provided Block Scope in JavaScript:

 -->


<h2>Redeclaring a Variable Using var</h2>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
var  x = 10;
// Here x is 8

{  
var x = 2;
// Here x is 2
}

// Here x is 2
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x;
</script>


<!-- Example
Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block: -->

<!-- Redeclaring Variables
Redeclaring a variable using the var keyword can impose problems.

Redeclaring a variable inside a block will also redeclare the variable outside the block: -->

<!-- Redeclaring a variable using the let keyword can solve this problem.

Redeclaring a variable inside a block will not redeclare the variable outside the block: -->

<h2>Redeclaring a Variable Using let</h2>

<p id="demo1"></p>

<script>
let  y = 10;
// Here x is 10

{  
  let y = 2;
  // Here x is 2
}

// Here x is 10
document.getElementById("demo1").innerHTML = y;
</script>

<!-- What is Good?
let and const have block scope.

let and const can not be redeclared.

let and const must be declared before use.

let and const does not bind to this.

let and const are not hoisted.

What is Not Good?
var does not have to be declared.

var is hoisted.

var binds to this. -->
