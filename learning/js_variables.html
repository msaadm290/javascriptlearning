<!-- Variables are Containers for Storing Data
JavaScript Variables can be declared in 4 ways:

Automatically
Using var
Using let
Using const -->

<!-- In this first example, x, y, and z are undeclared variables.

They are automatically declared when first used: -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<h1>JavaScript Variables</h1>

<p>In this example, x, y, and z are undeclared.</p>
<p>They are automatically declared when first used.</p>

<p id="value"></p>

<script>
x = 5;
y = 6;
z = x + y;
document.getElementById("value").innerHTML =
"The value of z is: " + z;
</script>


<!-- Note
It is considered good programming practice to always declare variables before use. -->


<!-- Note
The var keyword was used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.

The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015.

The var keyword should only be used in code written for older browsers.

-->

<!-- Mixed Example -->


<h1>JavaScript Variables</h1>

<p>In this example, price1, price2, and total are variables.</p>

<p id="value1"></p>

<script>
const price1 = 5;
const price2 = 6;
let total = price1 + price2;
document.getElementById("value1").innerHTML =
"The total is: " + total;


var name = "helo";
var name = "test";

let fname = "fname";
fname = "anchdf"
// let fname = "abc";

const lname = "lname"
// lname = "llkajsdf"

function testing(){
    // var test = "hello world";
    console.log(fname)
    console.log(lname)
}

// console.log('test',test)
// let lname = "helo2";
// const fname = "helofname";

testing()

console.log(name,lname,fname)
</script>

<!-- The two variables price1 and price2 are declared with the const keyword.

These are constant values and cannot be changed.

The variable total is declared with the let keyword.

The value total can be changed. -->

<!-- When to Use var, let, or const?
1. Always declare variables

2. Always use const if the value should not be changed

3. Always use const if the type should not be changed (Arrays and Objects)

4. Only use let if you can't use const

5. Only use var if you MUST support old browsers. -->

<!-- Note
Variables are containers for storing values. -->
